Source code accompanying the ECCV'16 paper "Multi-view 3D Models from Single Images with a Convolutional Network" by M. Tatarchenko, A. Dosovitskiy and T. Brox https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06702. This is a re-implementation of the models described in the paper, so we do not guarantee both quantitative and qualitative results to be exactly the same.
